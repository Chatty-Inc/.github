# Chatty

An organisation to hold the archived repositories of various
experimental Chatty frontend/backends. Development efforts
are stalled, but may be restarted at any time ðŸ˜‰

In the meantime, why not check out [Swiftcord, a fast, beautiful
and native Discord client for macOS](https://github.com/SwiftcordApp/Swiftcord)
that's in active development?
